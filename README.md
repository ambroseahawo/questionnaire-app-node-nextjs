# Context
You're part of a development team for a company that was hired by the University to create a specific software that will assist distant learning professors.
At first, your team was requested to do the following task: to make it possible for anyone who accesses the software to be able to create a questionnaire, where each question contains:
- Multiple answers (More than two).
- A weight with 3 different values.
- One right answer.
 
## Fullstack
Your team leader provides you with the following tasks to be worked on as a full-stack developer:
- All the necessary routes to enable the creation of the questionnaire.
- The MongoDB/mongoose manipulations to supply the routes.
- The HTML page to manipulate and see the questionnaire.
- The pages needs to be responsive.

*Also, it was asked that if possible, to make the questionnaire appear on a page, which at the end it can show the results for the user based on the weight of the answers.*

## Tester
Your team leader asked you to develop the following tasks:
- At least two routes for the back-end manipulations.
- Mongoose services for the routes created.
- At least one front-end component or page.
- Unitary Automated Tests for the routes and services developed.
- Unitary Test for the component or page developed.
 
# Observations:
It is important that you send the solution by the end of the deadline even if the solution isnâ€™t entirely completed.

It is your choice if you want to connect to a local database or an online cluster on MongoDB Atlas.

Please pay attention that you need to do only the tasks for your respective role, Full-stack or Tester, not for both.
